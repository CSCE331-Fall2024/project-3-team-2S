Connected DB to frontend through Express.js                                 David Higgins

Minutes from Previous Meeting:

    For this meeting, we met in person and was the beginning of our work for the third project. Since this meeting was the first, the previous meeting was discussing requirements for the project and what we would have to do. We briefly discussed different JS frameworks that we could possibly use, and talked about the database and how we would need to alter it to fit the new project. 
    We came up with a few ideas for our above and beyond functionality, including having one large screen that could have multiple kiosks running on the same touchscreen but large enough for multiple people to use at the same time. We decided that our above and beyond feature should be the ability to have rewards for customers since we have already added some of the functionality in our database side of things already.

Minutes from Previous Meeting:

    In the previous meeting, we talked about the project requirements a little more in depth. We then proceeded to share what frameworks would work best for this project. We ended up going with a React frontend that would easily plug into an Express.js backend. This is because some of our group already has experience working with React, which would accelerate our progress and help us get a quick start. We decided that we would use Express.js as the backend because we had learned that it works very well with interacting with our database. 
	We then talked about how we were going to start the approach for this project. We listed out all of the tasks that had to be done and assigned each one a priority. This priority indicates how important each task is and what order they should be completed. We then created assignments for individuals to do. This way we were all able to get started on the project and begin to create the web interface.

Minutes from Previous Meeting:
    
    We began with a general discussion on the project’s progress, covering the developments in the UI for customer and manager views. Everyone shared insights on how these layouts were structured and any adjustments needed to streamline user navigation. We also discussed how we successfully setup Express.js to handle database interactions which will allow is to connect the frontend and backend components of the application.
    Each team member shared obstacles encountered since the last sprint, such as minor issues with routing, some trouble with the initial database integration, and confusion on how to use Postman. However, identifying these challenges allowed us to collectively address them and find solutions to them before they became bigger issues.
    We also revisited the project roadmap, assessing which upcoming tasks should take priority to ensure steady progress. By defining each task’s significance, we created a focused approach that aligns with the project’s short-term goals.
